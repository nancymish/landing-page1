                <div class="para1">
                    <p>California, constituent state of the United States of America. It was admitted as the
                        31st state of the union on September 9, 1850, and by the early 1960s it was the most
                        populous U.S. state. No version of the origin of California’s name has been fully
                        accepted, but there is wide support for the contention that it derived from an early
                        16th-century Spanish novel, Las sergas de Esplandián (“The Adventures of Esplandián”),
                        that described a paradisiacal island full of gold and precious stones called California.
                        The influence of the Spanish settlers of the 18th and 19th centuries is evident in California’s
                        architecture and place-names. The capital is Sacramento.</p> <br>
                    <p>California is bounded by the U.S. state of Oregon to the north, by the states of
                        Nevada and Arizona to the east, by the Mexican state of Baja California to the south,
                        and by the Pacific Ocean to the west. From the rainy northern coast to the parched
                        Colorado Desert in the south, and from the Mediterranean-like central and southern
                        littoral to the volcanic plateau of the far northeast, California is a land of
                        stunning physical contrasts. Both the highest and lowest points in the 48 conterminous
                        states are in the state of California—Mount Whitney and Death Valley, respectively.
                        The former is the culminating summit of the Sierra Nevada, one of the major mountain
                        ranges of North America.</p><br>

                    <h2>Climate of California</h2>
                    <p>California’s climate is marked by two seasons—a wet and a dry. Except on the coast,
                        the dryness of the air and the consequent rapidity of evaporation greatly lessen
                        the severity of summer heat. Precipitation ranges from more than 170 inches (4,300 mm)
                        in the northwest to traces in the southeastern desert, but moderate temperatures and rainfall
                        prevail along the coast. The climate also changes rapidly with elevational extremes. Death
                        Valley, with its lowest point at 282 feet (86 metres) below sea level, is the hottest and driest
                        place in North America. Its temperatures easily soar into the 100s F (about 48 °C) in the
                        summer, and average annual rainfall is only about 2 inches (50 mm). Summer temperatures in the
                        low-lying Colorado Desert can reach as high as about 130 °F (54 °C), and annual precipitation
                        there averages only 3 to 4 inches (75 to 100 mm). In the higher eastern deserts of California,
                        summer temperatures are more moderate. Winter temperatures in the Sierra Nevada can drop to near
                        freezing. The average annual temperature is in the mid-60s F (about 18 °C) in Los Angeles, with
                        an annual precipitation average of about 14 inches (350 mm). In San Francisco temperatures
                        average in the mid-50s F (about 14 °C), with annual precipitation of about 20 inches (508 mm).
                        On the coast, temperatures seldom exceed 90 °F (32 °C) or drop to freezing, and humidity is low.

                    <h2>Plants and Animals</h2>
                    <p>California is the most biologically diverse state in the United States, with more than 40,000 plant
                    and animal species, some of which are endangered or threatened. Nearly one-fourth of all plant types
                    found in North America occur naturally within the borders of the state. The state is particularly
                    known for its redwood trees. Before European settlement the redwoods covered an estimated 2,000,000
                    acres (800,000 hectares) of California. Many redwood forests have been destroyed or substantially
                    altered by logging operations; however, about 200,000 acres (80,000 hectares) of redwoods are
                    protected in state and national parks. Other highly recognizable forms of plant life, emblematic of
                    different parts of the state, are the bristlecone pine, the palm, the creosote bush, and the
                    Monterey cypress. Yet, some of California’s most characteristic landscapes, particularly the coastal
                    region of the central and southern portions of the state, are dominated by plants introduced from
                    other countries, most notably Bermuda grass from southern Africa, the tree of heaven from China, the
                    thistle from Central Asia, and the giant reed from southern Europe.

                    Animal life in California is as varied as the geography; about 400 species of mammals and some 600
                    species of birds have been identified. Many are extinct or in danger of extirpation. The California
                    grizzly bear is extinct, for instance, and the bighorn sheep is found mostly in remote desert
                    mountains. Some species have been reintroduced or given protected status, including the California
                    condor, whose population has slowly regrown with the help of zoo hatching programs and wilderness
                    refuges. Wildcats and pumas (cougars) characteristically prowl remote mountain areas, though they
                    are increasingly coming into contact with humans as urban and suburban development expands. The more
                    common deer, bobcats, coyotes, skunks, raccoons, and black bears are found in various habitats. In
                    drier areas and deserts there are squirrels, jackrabbits, and chipmunks. Desert tortoises, horned
                    toads, and rattlesnakes are abundant in desert climates. Among common birds are California jays and
                    thrashers, juncos, mountain bluebirds, and hermit thrushes. Bass, perch, rockfish, and tuna are
                    found in the Pacific Ocean off California’s coast, as are many species of marine mammals.</p>
